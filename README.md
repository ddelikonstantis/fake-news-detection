# Fake News Detection with Python using nltk
Text classification is the process of categorizing text into one or more different classes to organize, structure, and filter into any parameter. It is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, medical studies and intent detection.

## Objective
This repository utilizes the [fake news dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data) from Kaggle to identify when an article might be fake news. Data preprocessing includes text cleaning, lowercasing, tokenization, lemmatization, stopwords removal. Data classification implemented with numerous Machine Learning algorithms and evaluated.

## Dependencies
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
